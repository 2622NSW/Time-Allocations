# Time-Allocations

This repository contains a single [xlsx](https://github.com/2622NSW/Time-Allocations/blob/master/Visualise%20Time%20Allocation.xlsx) file that provides an example of the use of filled [radar charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) in Excel.

The example used is of an imagined allocation of personal time in tertiary education contexts.
